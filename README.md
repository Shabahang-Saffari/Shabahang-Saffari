## My name is Shabahang...

**My coding** journey began with C++, but it was when I explored C# during my BS studies that things truly sparked my interest in programming. The world of Object-Oriented Programming fascinated me, and I started crafting fun projects such as a Persian calendar, phone book, etc.

**I have** continued my coding journey with learning other cool programming languages such as Python. **:microscope:** Currently I have been focusing on JavaScript and especially React.js and Node.js.
Send me a message and let's start chatting.
