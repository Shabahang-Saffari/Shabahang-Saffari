## :raising_hand_man: My name is Shabahang...

**My coding** journey began with C++, but it was when I explored C# during my BS studies that things truly sparked my interest in programming. The world of Object-Oriented Programming fascinated me, and I loved crafting fun projects such as a Persian calendar, phone book, etc.

On the other hand, my passion for the art of creation and my music background led me to pursue a masterâ€™s degree in music composition. However, I always knew I will eventually come back to the world of software engineering. Therefore, I embarked on a journey to refresh and expand my programming skills. I started taking programming courses such as Python, JavaScript, React.js, and Node.js. These courses not only brought me up to date with the latest developments in the field but also provided me with the tools to translate my creative instincts into innovative software solutions.

Now that I have completed those courses and have real-world projects under my belt, Iâ€™m excited for a full-time career in software engineering.
Feel free to shoot me a message, and let's dive into some coding conversations!
